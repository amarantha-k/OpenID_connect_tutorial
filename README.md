# OpenID\_connect\_tutorial

The goal of this tutorial is to help setting quickly the different components (CB Server, Sync Gateway, CB-Lite (Java) code and the third party Identity Provider) and establish an implicit flow authentication using the OpenID Connect protocol.

The source code of this tutorial is mainly derived from the Java CB-Lite "[Getting Started App](https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/2.7/java-platform.html#building-a-getting-started-app)"
project.  
## OpenID connection workflow

The tutorial will achieve to deploy and make collaborate all those differents components :

Note : KeyCloak (KC) has been chosen as the Identity Provider to work with because it is well-known, Red hat supported, and of course because I like it ðŸ˜„



## Deployment
Three docker containers wil be deployed :
 - 1 one-node Couchbase Server 6.5 instance
 - 1 Sync Gateway 2.7 instance
 - 1 Keycloak instance

 1 same network workshop2 will be used across all the docker containers.

 In addition, a CBLite Java (folder CBLite_code) project will be run on the host machine to simulate a CBLite client (App code).

### Deploy Keycloak (KC)

<code>docker run -p "8080:8080" --name keycloak --network workshop2  -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=password jboss/keycloak</code>

<b>Note : to be improved as no volumes are mapped here (every configuration done is lost after stopping the container).</b>

### Deploy Couchbase Server 6.5
<code>docker run -d --name cb-server --network workshop2 -p 8091-8094:8091-8094 -p 11210:11210 couchbase/server-sandbox:6.5.0</code>

### Deploy Sync Gateway 2.7
<code>docker run -p 4984-4985:4984-4985 --network workshop2 --name sync-gateway -d -v `pwd`/sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json:/etc/sync_gateway/sync_gateway.json couchbase/sync-gateway:2.7.0-enterprise -adminInterface :4985 /etc/sync_gateway/sync_gateway.json</code>

## Internal DNS modification for the Sync Gateway
As we will see, at some point, the Sync Gateway needs to check the <code>id_token</code> against the issuer of the token (the Identity Manager KC). As a consequence, the FQDN of KC has to be found at SG level.
To do so, the docker FQDN name "keycloak" has to be accessible from the Sync Gateway (which is not the case by default). To overcome this issue, we retrieve the local IP address of KC (using docker inspect) and hard-code it inside the /etc/hosts of the SyncGateway. Again, if the container is stopped, this configuration is lost and has to be re-done.


## Data populating

To populate this "<b>french_cuisine</b>" bucket with products (dishes), copy locally and  import the file <b>data/dataset.txt</b> containing inline json products definition:

```
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbimport json -g product::%id% -c localhost -u Administrator -p password -b french_cuisine --format lines -d file:///opt/couchbase/bin/dataset.txt
```

## Sync gateway configuration file
An example of the Sync gateway configuration file using OpenID Connect option can be found in the folder SG_sync_file. A dedicated "<b>french_cuisine</b>" bucket will be used for this tutorial.


## Explanations
TBD

### Keycloak configuration
TBD

### CBLite app code - step 1 : access login page 
TBD

### CBLite app code - step 2 : submit credentials and get the id_token 
TBD

### CBLite app code - step 3 : store id_token in session (at SG level)
TBD

### Define roles (channels) for those new users (using SG REST Admin calls)
TBD

## The use case
The test scenario is quite simple : 
- for each region, French cuisine local dishes are associated to people living in this area.

For example Fabrice and Julie are used to eat sausages and buckwheats crepes while Wolfgang and Gunter both enjoy tasting kouglof and "choucroute" (Sauerkraut) and so on...

- each user is given a regional role (Bretagne\_role, Alsace\_role or PACA\_role)
- each role contains 1 channel (it could be more of course).
- a channels attribute is defined in each product, for example :

```{  "id":"01_bouillabaisse",  "name": "bouillabaisse",  "price": "15 euros",  "channels": "PDV_PACA",  "type": "product"}
```

Here are the distribution of people and products per local region :

![](./users_local_products.png)

When logging in as Fabrice or Julie in KC, because of RBAC defined at <b>sync function</b> level, only local dishes from Brittany (Bretagne) should come up and sync.
Same thing respectivly for other regions/users.
